## How to run this code

1. Clone the repository and `cd` to the root directory
2. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/wesley-smith/mllib) into the root directory
3. Create a directory called `results`, also in the root directory. A bunch of pickle files will be stored here.
4. From a Python 3.x scientific environment (sklearn, pandas, numpy, jupyter, etc.) do the following:
  1. Generate plots with `adult.ipynb` and `mnist.ipynb`. Apologies for the mess.
  2. Run Neural Net tests with `run_nn_tests.py`
